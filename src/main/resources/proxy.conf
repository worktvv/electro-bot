# Proxy Configuration for Electro Bot
# =====================================
#
# This file configures proxy servers for accessing the ROE website
# when direct connection is blocked (e.g., from Railway hosting).
#
# FORMAT:
# - Lines starting with # are comments
# - Empty lines are ignored
# - Proxy format: host:port or host:port:username:password
# - Settings format: setting_name=value
#
# SETTINGS:
# - timeout_seconds: Connection timeout for each proxy (default: 15)
# - notify_admin_on_failure: Send message to admin if all proxies fail (default: true)
#
# PROXY TYPES SUPPORTED:
# - HTTP proxies (most common)
# - SOCKS proxies are NOT supported
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Bot first tries direct connection to the website
# 2. If direct fails, tries each proxy in order
# 3. If all proxies fail, admin receives notification
# 4. Cached data from database is used until next refresh attempt
#
# EXAMPLE PROXIES (replace with your own):
# 123.45.67.89:8080
# proxy.example.com:3128
# proxy.example.com:8080:username:password
#
